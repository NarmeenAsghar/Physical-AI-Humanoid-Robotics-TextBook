# Lesson Template Generator Skill

**Status**: ✅ Active - Phase 1 Implementation

**Purpose**: Generates standardized lesson markdown files with all required sections for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

---

## Overview

The Lesson Template Generator creates consistent, structured lesson files with frontmatter and 7 mandatory sections. This skill ensures all lessons follow the same format, making content creation easier and maintaining consistency across the entire textbook.

---

## Phase 1 Usage Strategy

**Active Role**: Used by Content Architect to create ALL 6 lesson files

**Content Strategy**:
- **Lessons 1.1, 2.1, 3.1**: Templates REPLACED by Technical Writer with full content
- **Lessons 1.2, 2.2, 3.2**: KEEP the template as placeholder content (sidebar display only)

This approach balances:
- Time constraints (Sunday deadline)
- Demonstration value (3 complete lessons show capability)
- User experience (6 lessons visible in sidebar for structure)

---

## Template Structure

### Frontmatter (YAML)

```yaml
---
sidebar_position: [POSITION_NUMBER]
title: [LESSON_TITLE]
description: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
---
```

**Fields**:
- `sidebar_position`: Integer (1, 2, 3...) - determines order in sidebar
- `title`: String - full lesson title displayed in sidebar and page header
- `description`: String - brief summary for SEO and metadata

---

### Template Output

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 1
title: [LESSON_TITLE]
description: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
---

## Usage Instructions

### For Content Architect Subagent

The Content Architect uses this template when generating lesson files:

1. **Parse lesson information** from COURSE_CONTENT.md
2. **Replace placeholders**:
   - `[LESSON_TITLE]` → Actual lesson title
   - `[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]` → Extract from course content
   - `[POSITION_NUMBER]` → Lesson number (1, 2, etc.)
3. **Keep placeholder text** in sections (Introduction, Key Concepts, etc.)
4. **Write file** to `docs/docs/chapter-XX-slug/lesson-XX-slug.md`

### For Technical Writer Subagent

The Technical Writer replaces template content for lessons 1.1, 2.1, 3.1:

1. **Read existing lesson file** generated by Content Architect
2. **Replace placeholder text** with actual content:
   - Introduction: Write compelling 2-3 sentence intro
   - Learning Objectives: Create specific, measurable objectives
   - Key Concepts: Write detailed explanations with examples
   - Hands-on Exercise: Design practical activity with clear steps
   - Quiz: Create meaningful assessment questions
   - Key Takeaways: Summarize most important points
   - Further Reading: Add real resources with URLs
3. **Preserve frontmatter** (sidebar_position, title, description)
4. **Write updated file** back to same location

---

## 7 Mandatory Sections

All lesson files MUST include these sections:

1. ✅ **Introduction** - Context and importance
2. ✅ **Learning Objectives** - What students will learn
3. ✅ **Key Concepts** - Core ideas explained in depth
4. ✅ **Hands-on Exercise** - Practical application
5. ✅ **Quiz** - Assessment with answers
6. ✅ **Key Takeaways** - Summary points
7. ✅ **Further Reading** - Additional resources

---

## Validation Rules

**Frontmatter**:
- Must be valid YAML
- Must include all 3 required fields
- sidebar_position must be integer

**Content**:
- All 7 sections must be present
- Section headers must use `##` (level 2 heading)
- Quiz answers must be in `<details>` tag
- Learning Objectives must use checkboxes `- [ ]`

**Links**:
- "Next Lesson" link must point to next lesson file (relative path)
- Further Reading links can be placeholders (#) until filled by Technical Writer
